# Overview

This project is a web application that is used to display customer invoices and sales revenue. The home page will display revenue history and trends, as well as some of the latest invoices. The invoice page will show an extensive history or editable invoices to look through with information on the customers.

My purpose for writing this software is to get practice with creating a full-stack web application. As I create larger and larger projects, the ability to connect server and client will become more necessary. Having a stepping stone, like this, is a great opportunity for me to learn what it is that I do not know.
